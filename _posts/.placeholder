# Welcome to my new DFIR (Digital Forensics and Incident Response) blog! 

 My name is **Alexander Capraro** and I am a SOC Analyst at **ReliaQuest**. I have a passion for all things cyber security and am excited to share my insights and experiences with you on this blog.

 On this blog, I will be discussing a variety of topics related to DFIR, including **forensic analysis** techniques, incident response **best practices**, and the latest tools and trends in the field. I hope that my posts will be useful for those working in DFIR, as well as anyone interested in learning more about cyber security and staying up-to-date on the **latest threats and vulnerabilities.**

Thank you for joining me on this journey. I look forward to sharing my thoughts and insights with you, and to learning from your experiences as well.
